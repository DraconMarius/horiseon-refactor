# Code Refactor: Horiseon 
## Description
This is a code-refactor project on a webpage for Horiseon Inc. I was tasked with introducing accessibility standards with the starter code that I was given.

This will improve the search engine visibility, and allows for increased foot traffic.

### Goals
- [x] Title is clear and 'searchable'
- [x] HTML in logical order
- [x] Includes Semantic HTML elements 
- [x] Includes images alt attributes
- [x] CSS properties are in logical order
- [x] ~90% likeness compared to original
- [x] HTML & CSS Comments
- [ ] Supports various screensizes (WIP)

## Personal Note
To introduce new concepts that I had recently learned, I implemented a `flex box` to the nav bar top of the webpage. Give the window a quick (horizontal) <-> resize to see it in action! (just don't scroll down... yet)
