# Code Refactor: Horiseon 
## Description
This is a code-refactor project on a webpage for Horiseon Inc. I was tasked with introducing accessibility standards with the starter code that I was given.

This will improve the search engine visibility, and allows for increased foot traffic.

### Goals
- [*] Title is clear and 'searchable'
- [*] HTML in logical order
- [*] Includes Semantic HTML elements 
- [*] Includes images alt attributes
- [*] CSS properties are in logical order
- [*] ~90% likeness compared to original
- [ ] HTML & CSS Comments
- [ ] Supports various screensizes (WIP)

---

## Personal Note
To introduce new concepts that I had recently learned, I implemented a `flex box` to the nav bar top of the webpage. Give the window a quick (horizontal) <-> resize to see it in action! (just don't scroll down... yet)
